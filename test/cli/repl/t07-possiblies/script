-- Divisions return Possibles.
-- Try with group:
feature salary ~> group (int (double value / 200)) ~> sum (double value / 5) / 5

-- Distincts
feature salary ~> distinct (double value / 5) ~> sum (double value / 5) / 5

-- Maybe some lets
feature salary ~> let x = 2 / 1 ~> sum (int (double value * x))

-- Add a filter
feature salary ~> let x = 2 / 1 ~> filter (double value > x) ~> count value

-- newest or something
feature salary ~> (newest (double value) / 5, oldest (double value / 5), sum value)

-- This was causing an issue with nested possibility cases before
feature salary ~> latest 1 ~> case (0,sum value) | (z,s) -> s end
