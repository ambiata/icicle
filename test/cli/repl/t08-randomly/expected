REPL Error:
Check error:
  Cannot discharge constraints at 1:35
  Constraints: 
    1:35  Conflicting let temporalities.
          This kind of let isn't allowed because its definition could never be used.
          The definition is a Aggregate, while the body is a Element.

REPL Error:
Check error:
  Cannot discharge constraints at 1:19
  Constraints: 
    1:19  Cannot unify: (Sum check$5 check$3)
          With type:    (Sum check$9 (Sum check$5 check$3))
          These types were required to be equal, but are not.
