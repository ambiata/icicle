-- Extracting FactIdentifiers from Buffers:
--
--
-- After the end of the ForeachFacts loop, we need to go through the FactIdentifier buffers and
-- call KeepFactInHistory for each FactIdentifier.
-- This is a bit trickier than you might think:
--  1. Bufs might be nested inside other places, like inside Maps or inside tuples
--  2. We won't necessarily read from all the bufs, but bufs we don't read might be important next time
--    (Imagine we have a Map of Bufs, and we choose one entry to read the values from and return.
--     The next time we run, we might not choose the same entry, so we need to make sure all the Bufs are saved)
--
-- So, we need to modify flatten to keep track of all Accumulators in scope (or perhaps only accumulators with nested Buf types).
-- For each accumulator, we need to generate code for traversing the structure and finding the nested Bufs.
-- When we find the Buf, we can read the fact identifiers and mark them as necessary.
--
-- (It might be worth storing each accumulator's original type, rather than the modified/tupled type,
-- as searching for a Buf is probably easier than searching for the first element in tuple of two bufs)
