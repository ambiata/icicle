-- | Provide a *slightly* better interface to pretty printer.
--
-- Problem is that it defines (<>), but so does Data.Monoid.
--
-- Its (<>) really is a monoid though, so hiding it and adding
-- an orphan instance that does the same thing seems fine to me.
--
-- The pretty printer also defines <$> which isn't an applicative.
-- We will just hide that one.
