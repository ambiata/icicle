-- | A-normalise expressions
-- A-normal form is where the function and arguments of an application
-- can only be simple expressions such as values, variables, and primitives,
-- and let bindings are serialised.
--
-- For example,
--
--   map (+(5-2)) [1,2,3]
--
-- would end up as something like
--
--   let a = 5 - 2
--   let b = (+a)
--   let c = [1,2,3]
--   in  map b c
--
-- Conversion to a-normal form is not a benefit in itself, but simplifies
-- later transformations.
