-- | Statements in a scoped way.
-- Some representations are better for different things:
-- the inner/nested way of statement is better for type checking and evaluating,
-- but tedious for inserting new let bindings.
--
-- This Scoped representation makes inserting bindings better.
--
-- It's also nicer for pretty printing to your average imperative
-- language, since the block structure of an imperative language
-- don't actually correspond to the scopes.
