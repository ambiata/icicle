-- | The environment stores previously bound expressions.
-- These expressions can refer to names that are bound upwards.
-- This would be fine if there were no shadowing, but with shadowing we may end up
-- rebinding a name that is mentioned in another expression:
--
-- let a = 10
-- let b = a + 1
-- let a = 8
-- let s = a + 1
-- in  s
--
-- Here, s and b are locally alpha equivalent, but not really equivalent because they
-- refer to different "a"s.
-- When we see the second "a" binding, then, we must remove "b" from the environment of
-- previously bound expressions.
